# <div align="center">Bonus Homework 9</div>

### Deadline: 24 May

### Task
As a bonus challenge, you are tasked with implementing a Red-Black Tree data structure in JavaScript. Red-Black Trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree. This exercise will deepen your understanding of tree structures and balancing algorithms.

### **Instructions**

1. **Red-Black Tree Implementation**: Create a class for a Red-Black Tree that includes methods for insertion, deletion, and searching. Implement the Red-Black Tree balancing rules to ensure that the tree remains balanced after each operation.
2. **Insertion**: Implement the insertion operation for the Red-Black Tree. Ensure that the tree maintains the Red-Black properties, including colorings and rotations as necessary.
3. **Deletion**: Implement the deletion operation for the Red-Black Tree. Handle cases for both removing nodes with no children, one child, and two children while preserving the Red-Black properties.
4. **Search**: Implement a method to search for a specific value in the Red-Black Tree. Ensure that the search operation is efficient and respects the tree's structure.

### **Submission**

Submit your JavaScript code for the Red-Black Tree implementation along with detailed comments and documentation explaining your implementation. Provide examples of inserting, deleting, and searching for values in the Red-Black Tree.

### **Running the app**

```bash
$ node index
```
